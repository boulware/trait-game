Editor stuff
*1) Labels for property UI elements
*2) Action slots with pop-up menu that lets you select from the available actions
3) "Recently edited" display, so it's easy to find stuff you've been editing recently.
4) Need a way to "eat" clicks when a dropdown box is opened, and one of its entries is selected, but the rect overlaps another UI element (selecting the entry also focuses the overlapping UI element right now)
5) Editing a unit to have more actions than it previously had crashes (because UnitSchematic.action_schematics is not always length 4, but it probably should be). Related: I need to implement an "empty" action, because I think most of the codebase assumes that all elements of Unit.actions will be actual Action objects, but letting them be None would be useful.
