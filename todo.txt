\* Tweens with negative values in the end_pos don't work properly.
	=> It's because I'm not parsing negative numbers properly in the regex
\* Tweens with negative jerk throw an error when t=0 (because 0 to a negative power)
*Implement multiples tweens in .dat loading
*Fix crash when there's a move in animations.dat that doesn't match with the given unit name.
	=> On top of that, some general error reporting when the animations are invalidly defined would be good too
